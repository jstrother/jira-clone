# jira-clone

This project was built to help me learn more about Rust. I also built it to keep track of projects I build on my own.

## Further things to add

- Add a way to show epic and story info on new pages.
  - This is so I can see epic/story names and descriptions in full. Right now for example, the description is truncated.
- Add a way to edit epic/story names and descriptions
  - I need a way to update things as the need may arise.
- Add a way to give more information on each epic and story
  - This would be something along the lines of notes to keep things on track, ideas about what to do to complete the epic/story, etc.
